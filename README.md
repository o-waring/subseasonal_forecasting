# Subseasonal Rodeo

#### **Predicting subseasonal temperature & precipitation 3-4 and 5-6 weeks ahead for Western USA across 514 geographical regions**

#### Introduction

Water and fire managers in Western USA rely on subseasonal (2-6 weeks ahead) forecasts to allocate water resources, manage wildfires, and prepare for droughts and other weather extremes [1]. Physical PDE based models typically dominate shorter term weather forecasts, however these become more chaotic in nature for subseasonal time frames. The abundant availability of meterological records (https://www.noaa.gov/) and computational resources allows for statistical and machine learning approaches to be employed to improve the skill of the longer term forecasts. In colaboration with the US Government and leading US Universities, Topcoder hosted a competitive challenge running through 2020 (Subseasonal Rodeo) to incentivize community engagement and stimulate development in this important area.

This repo outlines a hybrid spatial-temporal deep learning approach to the subseasonal forecasting task.
